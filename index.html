            <!-- <h4 style="color:red;">Perché il pugilato?</h4>
            <p>Come preparatore assisto gli atleti attraverso strategie
              basate sullo sviluppo delle capacità condizionali (forza,
              velocità, resistenza).
              Sono specializzato in pugilato: i corsi di avviamento al
              pugilato, seguendo un percorso morbido e progressivo,
              rendono questo sport un’attività sicura, adatta a un pubblico
              sia maschile che femminile. L’allenamento comporta un buon
              condizionamento aerobico di base e consente di sviluppare
              un fisico atletico e scattante con buone capacità di
              autodifesa.</p>
               -->
            
              <!-- 
              
              <h4 style="color:red;">Corsi di autodifesa e pugilato</h4>
              <p>I corsi di avviamento al pugilato seguono un percorso morbido e progressivo che rende questo sport un' attività sicura e adatta ad un pubblico sia maschile che femminile. L'allenamento comporta un buon condizionamento aerobico di base, ideale per il sistema cardiocircolatorio, che consente di sviluppare un fisico atletico e scattante con buone capacità di autodifesa oltre a migliorare la percezione di autostima e consapevolezza delle proprie capacità.</p>

              <h4 style="color:red;">Preparazione atletica</h4>
              <p>E' rivolta sia ad atleti evoluti che  di minore esperienza e ha come scopo la pianificazione a breve, medio e lungo termine della massima prestazione sportiva individuale. Il mio metodo, si basa sull'ottimizzazione delle capacità organico muscolari (forza, potenza, rapidità, resistenza e mobilità articolare) e pone la massima attenzione alla prevenzione di infortuni e traumi da sovraccarico, attraverso il principio di alternanza e incremento progressivo degli impegni di lavoro.</p>  
                
              <h4 style="color:red;">Pilates per tutti</h4>
              <p>Nel mio lungo percorso nel settore sportivo è emersa con sempre maggiore chiarezza l'importanza di curare l'aspetto preventivo-conservativo, spesso trascurato nell'allenamento. Nasce così il mio interesse per metodiche come il Pilates. Questa disciplina, a mio avviso fondamentale, grazie alla sua stretta connessione mente-corpo rende ogni movimento frutto del pensiero. Tale legame intrinseco consente al praticante di acquisire un pieno controllo della muscolatura profonda che stabilizza la colonna vertebrale, base su cui costruire movimenti più complessi. Questa tecnica si configura quindi come supporto ideale per ogni metodo di allenamento. Per la qualità del movimento e la sequenzialità dell'approccio, il Pilates, può essere praticato ad ogni età.</p>

              <h4 style="color:red;">La passione per lo sport</h4>
              <p>
                Il  viaggio nel mondo dello sport comincia all'età di quattro anni con il judo e il nuoto, che continuo a livello agonistico per 8 anni. Nel corso della mia lunga esperienza sportiva ho praticato e pratico tutt'ora diverse attività (tra cui rugby, tennis, sci, sollevamento pesi, kettlebell lifting, power lifting, animal flow, kite surf ecc.), che contribuiscono ad arricchire la mia preparazione con un approccio a trecentosessanta gradi. A diciotto anni scopro il pugilato, che diventerà la mia grande passione a cui da allora mi dedico anima e corpo. Dopo una parentesi agonistica come pugile dilettante durata oltre un decennio, approdo all'insegnamento spinto dal desiderio di trasmettere il patrimonio tecnico-tattico accumulato in oltre venticinque anni di esperienza maturata in Italia e all'estero (Francia, Brasile) al fianco di atleti di alto livello. Parallelamente a queste attività approfondisco la conoscenza della tecnica pugilistica documentandomi sulla letteratura pertinente e amplio il mio bagaglio tecnico/ scientifico frequentando i corsi all'università di Bologna fino al conseguimento della laurea in Scienze motorie. Negli ultimi anni, sempre in cerca di nuovi stimoli inizio a frequentare i corsi di Brazilian Jiu Jitsu del Maestro Gianluca Boni, gareggiando in diverse competizioni. Tra il 2016 e il 2017 la passione per questo nuovo sport mi porta a Rio de Janeiro dove per approfondire lo studio di questa meravigliosa disciplina, mi alleno con il celebre Maestro Ricardo De la Riva. La mia esperienza raggiunge il suo culmine nel 2018 al Firenze Challenge, dove vinco il titolo di campione italiano master tre nelle cinture bianche Attualmente sono cintura blu (Rio Grappling Bologna).
              </p>
  
              <h4 style="color:red;">Esperienze e collaborazioni</h4>
              <p>La mia collaborazione con la storica palestra bolognese Pugilistica Tranvieri, in cui mi sono formato come atleta, sotto la guida del Maestro Antonio tarozzi, è durata diversi anni (dal 2007 al 2017). Qui ho maturato esperienza come insegnante e TECNICO SPORTIVO. Dal 2017 al 2019, in qualità di consulente tecnico di pugilato per il team Pro-Fighting del Maestro Mario Zanotti (sempre Avanti Bologna) ho curato la preparazione fisica di atleti dilettanti e professionisti di Muai Thai e kick boxing, tra cui Maldin Hamzai, vincitore nel 2018 del titolo mondiale di K-1 negli 80 kg per la sigla WKA. Particolarmente stimolante è stata l'esperienza con il gruppo di lottatori di Andrea Minguzzi, oro olimpico a Pechino nella lotta greco-romana, che nel 2017, insieme al maestro di Grappling e Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Simone Baldi, mi hanno chiamano a far parte della squadra U.S.I.L (Unione Sportiva Imolese Lotta) con il compito di perfezionare e affinare la tecnica pugilistica dei lottatori di MMA. Attualmente tengo corsi di autodifesa e avviamento al pugiilato presso il centro Solaris e la Palestra Refran a Bologna.

                  Nonostante questo, però, siamo riusciti
                  a portare avanti un progetto di power training per cercare di accrescere la forza, nello specifico
                  legata<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4"> all’esplosività e la tecnica
                    dei colpi. Per ottenere questo, Andrea ha studiato dei circuiti di resistenza alla forza adatti al
                    mio stile pugilistico e ai miei punti di forza e debolezza,
                    e delle sedute di figure ai pad. Ha adottato delle varianti sia con sovraccarico che a corpo libero,
                    a causa dell’incertezza sull’utilizzo
                    della palestra causa Covid-19, che si sono rivelati essere molto adattabili a seconda del luogo dove
                    poterli svolgere.
                    Nei due match successivi ho potuto riscontrare il miglioramento di prestazione legato
                    all’accrescimento della forza per il quale avevamo lavorato.
                    Il miglioramento è stato possibile anche grazie alla buona volontà di Andrea, che si è preoccupato
                    di darmi consigli e organizzare degli allenamenti
                    anche nei giorni festivi e anche nei parchi, per poter sfruttare tutto il tempo a disposizione e

                    Consiglio Andrea a chiunque voglia migliorarsi nello striking e/o voglia ricercare il miglioramento
                    della forma fisica.

            <p>I corsi di avviamento al pugilato seguono un percorso morbido e progressivo che rende questo sport un'attività sicura e adatta ad un pubblico sia maschile che femminile. L'allenamento comporta un buon condizionamento aerobico di base, ideale per il sistema cardiocircolatorio, che consente di sviluppare un fisico atletico e scattante con buone capacità di autodifesa oltre a migliorare la percezione di autostima e consapevolezza delle proprie capacità.</p>

            <h4 style="color:red;">Pilates per tutti</h4>
            <p>Nel mio lungo percorso nel settore sportivo è emersa con sempre maggiore chiarezza l'importanza di curare l'aspetto preventivo-conservativo, spesso trascurato nell'allenamento. Nasce così il mio interesse per metodiche come il Pilates. Questa disciplina, a mio avviso fondamentale, grazie alla sua stretta connessione mente-corpo rende ogni movimento frutto del pensiero. Tale legame intrinseco consente al praticante di acquisire un pieno controllo della muscolatura profonda che stabilizza la colonna vertebrale, base su cui costruire movimenti più complessi. Questa tecnica si configura quindi come supporto ideale per ogni metodo di allenamento. Per la qualità del movimento e la sequenzialità dell'approccio, il Pilates, può essere praticato ad ogni età.</p>

            <h4 style="color:red;">Animal Flow</h4>
            <p>Animal Flow è sistema di allenamento a corpo libero, che non richiede
              attrezzature e utilizza unicamente il peso corpo e la forza di gravità come
              forza antagoniste. Sfruttando questa opposizione a nostro vantaggio,
              attraverso un ampio repertorio di esercizi e combinazioni di movimenti
              multiplanari, riusciamo a distribuire lo sforzo, sviluppare forza e
              resistenza.
              La principale caratteristica posturale di questo metodo è la quadrupedia,
              che utilizza il corpo con entrambe le mani ed entrambi i piedi in appoggio
              al suolo. Questa postura impone carichi atipici e variabili che sollecitano
              tessuti e muscoli a reagire in modo elastico, offrendo un impatto benefico
              sulla flessibilità delle articolazioni.
              Chi pratica AF è stimolato a riscoprire il proprio corpo e a prendere
              coscienza di come questo si muove nello spazio circostante. Questa abilità
              di connessione amplifica la consapevolezza, la cognizione e la
              propriocezione.
              Animal Flow è stato pensato per colmare le lacune nell’allenamento, un
              “collante” per unire tutte le abilità motorie(Forza, potenza,
              coordinazione, equilibrio velocità, resistenza, flessibilità, mobilità).</p>

          <p>È rivolta sia ad atleti evoluti che  di minore esperienza e ha come scopo la pianificazione a breve, medio e lungo termine della massima prestazione sportiva individuale. Il mio metodo, si basa sull'ottimizzazione delle capacità organico muscolari (forza, potenza, rapidità, resistenza e mobilità articolare) e pone la massima attenzione alla prevenzione di infortuni e traumi da sovraccarico, attraverso il principio di alternanza e incremento progressivo degli impegni di lavoro.</p>
